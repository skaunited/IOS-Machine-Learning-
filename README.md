#IOSMLearningAPP

This is a simple demo project of an IOS Machine Learning APP. 
the Idea is playing with the CoreML apple SKD to make a simple mobile app,
that maybe could recognise some objects that we should capture using our Camera.
Once that done we could fetch the data returned from VNCoreMLRequest  
to add it in the ItemController TabBar title as identifier object and confidence percent
